# Personalized Product Recommendation System

This project implements a personalized product recommendation system using a machine learning model, with a FastAPI backend and an Angular frontend.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the FastAPI application.
- `model/`: Stores the trained machine learning model (`model.pkl`).
- `frontend/`: The Angular application for the frontend.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js and npm (for the Angular frontend)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage

Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/recommendations/` with a JSON body containing the user ID and the desired number of recommendations, for example:

```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "num_recommendations": 5
}
```

The API will return a list of personalized product recommendations.

# Predictive Analytics Backend

This project implements a backend server for predictive analytics using ARIMA and LSTM models, primarily focused on customer behavior prediction. It serves as the backend for an Angular frontend application.

## Features

- Predict future customer behavior using LSTM.
- Forecast time series data with ARIMA.
- Serve predictions through a RESTful API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip
- virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://yourrepository.com/path/to/repo.git
cd predictive-analytics-backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed.

. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

5. Run the server:

```bash
python -m server
```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

The server exposes several endpoints for making predictions and retrieving forecast data. Here are some examples:

### Predict Next Purchase

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/predict/next_purchase -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"customer_id": 123}'
```

### Forecast Sales

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/forecast/sales?days=30
```

Replace `localhost:5000` with your deployment address if not running locally.
